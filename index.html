    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        I am currently a master student at FIBLAB, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, advised by Prof. Yong Li. 
        I received my bachelor degree from the Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University in 2022.

        My research primarily focuses on reinforcement learning, particularly its applications in areas such as the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), ride-hailing services, and electricity scheduling. Technically, my work centers on multi-agent reinforcement learning, and recently, I have been exploring the integration of large language models (LLM) with reinforcement learning.
